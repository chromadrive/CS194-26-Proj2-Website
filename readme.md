### About This Repository

This repo hosts the project writeup website created for Project 2 of Berkeley's **CS 194-26** *(Image Manipulation and Computational Photography)*. The task was to create and demonstrate applications of a pinhole camera; the website showcases our process, testing, final results, and cool "bells and whistles" applications we came up with. For more info, see the [project specifications](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa18/hw/proj2/index.html).

The code for our "bells and whistles" features was written in Python using Numpy/Scipy and OpenCV, and this writeup website was created using Bootstrap 4.0.
